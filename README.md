This project implements a JPA-based controller for managing Producto entities. The ProductoJpaController class provides methods to register new products, retrieve all products, and search for a product by its ID using Java Persistence API (JPA) with an EntityManagerFactory. The code is structured for easy integration with Java applications that require basic CRUD operations for product management.
